History
On 28 May 2015, CEO Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy founded Brave Software.[7] On 20 January 2016 Brave Software launched the first version of Brave with an ad-blocking feature, and announced plans for a privacy-respecting ad-feature and a revenue-sharing program.

In June 2018, Brave released a pay-to-surf test-version of the browser. This version of Brave came preloaded with approximately 250 ads, and sent a detailed log of the user's browsing activity to Brave for the short-term purpose of testing this functionality. Brave announced that expanded trials would follow.[9] Later that month Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode.

Until December 2018, Brave ran on a fork of Electron called Muon, which they marketed as a "more secure fork". Nevertheless, Brave developers moved to Chromium, citing a need to ease their maintenance burden.[11] Brave Software released the final Muon-based version with the intention that it would stop working and instructed users to update as its end-of-life approached.

In June 2019, Brave started testing a new ad-blocking rule-matching algorithm implemented in Rust, replacing the previous C++ one. The uBlock Origin and Ghostery algorithms inspired the new logic, which Brave claims to be on average 69 times faster than the previous algorithm.

Brave launched its stable release, version 1.0, on 13 November 2019, while having 8.7 million monthly active users overall.[14] At the time, it had approximately 3 million active users on a daily basis. Brave 1.0, running on Android, iOS, Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, integrated "almost all of Brave's marquee features across all platforms", according to engadget.

In November 2020, Brave reported having 20 million monthly users[16][17] and in February 2021 it passed 25 million monthly active users mark.

In January 2021, Brave integrated Ecosia as one of its search engine options.

In March 2021, Brave acquired Tailcat, a search engine developed by Cliqz.

In April 2021, Brave becomes the first browser to be added to the Epic Games Store.
